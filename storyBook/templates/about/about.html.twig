                    <p class="header">About</p>
                    <p>Once upon a time, there used to be a website development student named Paul. He did very well in
                        coding. Thanks to that, he was ahead of the whole class most of the time, what made him bored
                        sometimes. However, this triggered his creativity and proactivity. He was thinking more and
                        more about a project that he would be able to enjoy, it would improve his coding skills and as a
                        bonus, he would create something useful for others.</p>
                    <p>Paul's idea for the project was born - but wait! It was a great idea, however, Paul was more back end web developer, he can't help it but he hate front end. Thus, he wasn't really having mood to spent his time with
                        something that he doesn't like as much. And so he got another great idea - call Míša! - his web
                        development classmate. He told her about his intention and offered her if she would like to
                        participate in this project. Because Míša is crazy about the front end, word gave word and they
                        started planning their future misterpiece.
                    </p>
                    <p> And that is how our idea for this website was born.</p>
                    <h1 class="name">The project</h1>
                    <p>Do you like to listen the stories about your ancestors? Or maybe create something that will memorise important moments in you life for you or your children? </p>
                    <p>Are you tired of chaos, adds, messy look and too many contents on social media? It somehow feel less personal, right?</p>
                    <p>Well, sometimes less is more. </p>
                    <p>This is a combination of Diary / Album / Story book where you can keep your unique thoughts and
                        experiences in your life. Why is it unique? Because it is not about quantity as on social media but about quality.</p>
